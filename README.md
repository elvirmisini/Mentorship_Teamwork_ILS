# Mentorship_Teamwork_ILS
# Phase 3:


### On this phase we added more operation to get a better solution, and in some cases we doubled the results with a valid solution, we also build a delta function which is a difference between past solution and the actual running soultion, and we build this project to run like a command line, so to execute this project we first neeed to go to the src folder:

and we run:

```java
javac Main.java
```
and than we type "java Main b 5" which means that instance "b" will be executed for 5 minutes like this:
```java
java Main b 5
```
and than we wait for the solution, which can be like this

#### This project was worked on within the framework of the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, department of Computer Engineering, for "Algorithms Inspired by Nature" course, the problem is from Google Hash Code: [Mentorship and Teamwork](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/round/00000000008caae7/000000000098afc8).
- Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering: https://fiek.uni-pr.edu/

#### Development and Develoeprs
- This project was developet first, python language, lately changed into java programming language, it was build during the 2-nd semester of Master Studies for "Algorithms Inspired by Nature" course, and was mentored by professor of the course Kadri Sylejmani, and the assistant of the course Labeat Arbneshi.
- This project was developed by two developers(in this case also Students):
#### Uran Laj√ßi               email: uran.lajci@student.uni-pr.edu
#### Elvir Misini             email: elvir.misini@student.uni-pr.edu
